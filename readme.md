After clonning, if virtualenv not installed, install it with: "python3 -m pip install virtualenv"
Then, create a virtual environment and activate that. You can follow these command: 

`virtualenv env_name (for creating the virtual environment)`

`. ./env_name/bin/activate (if you are on linux)` or
 
 `env_name\Scripts\activate.bat (for windows)`

after that, run the preinstall file with : `python3 preinstall.py` to complete the installation. (make sure your terminal or cmd working directory is in the preinstall file's directory)
